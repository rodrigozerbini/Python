#  If the array is sorted,
#  A[i+2] + A[i+1] > A[i] is always true and
#  A[i+2] + A[i] > A[i+1] is always true.
#  So, I just need to check if
#  A[i+1] + A[i] > A[i+2].
#  In order to avoid A[i] + A[i + 1] > MAXINT and the code 
#  striking an overflow (with a result greater than
#  allowed integer limit), weÂ´ll modify the formula
#  to an equivalent A[i] > A[i+2] - A[i+1]
